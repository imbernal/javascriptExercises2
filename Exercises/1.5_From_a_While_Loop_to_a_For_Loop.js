// Video 1.4 accompanies this exercise

// Write a basic for loop that prints to the console all
// the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. This is the similar to one
// of the previous challenges, but this time weâ€™re using a for loop instead
// of a while loop.

for (var i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
	console.log(i);
}
